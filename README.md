# Openscad Card Box Library

Goal of this repo is to easily create generic deck boxes for storage board game pieces.  I would like to also extend this functionality to also create storage boxes for tokens as well.  In addition, I'd like deck boxes that _serve_ the cards, not just store them.  Ultimately, I'd like to have some container that does both.  It can both store inside the box nicely and be presentable in game just by placing it on the table.

The current case study is Eldrich Horror, which I own all 8 expansions for.  I've already got a solution built and implemented for storing all the ancient one card decks together, which is the inspiration for this project.
